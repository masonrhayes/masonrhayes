## Hi :wave:, I'm Mason! 

I work as an Economics Consultant (Intern) at [AlixPartners](https://www.alixpartners.com/services/economics-consulting/) in London ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenrskelton/flag-icon/master/png/16/country-4x3/gb.png), focused on antitrust litigation, particularly in digital platforms.

In 2022 I have graduated from the [Toulouse School of Economics (TSE)](https://tse-fr.eu/) ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenrskelton/flag-icon/master/png/16/country-4x3/fr.png) with a Master's degree in the [Economics of Markets and Organizations](https://www.tse-fr.eu/master-emo-international-track), and I graduated in May 2020 from the [University of Oklahoma (OU)](https://www.ou.edu/) ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenrskelton/flag-icon/master/png/16/country-4x3/us.png) with a Bachelor's degree in Economics and International Studies.

At TSE, my projects have included examining the health and welfare effects of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, as well as using a quasi-experimental differences-in-differences approach to estimate the effects of an earthquake on the level of informal competition in Chile (see the paper [here](https://masonrhayes.keybase.pub/projects/hayes_et_al_2021.pdf)). Other projects include:

- [Estimating a logit demand model in Julia](https://github.com/masonrhayes/business_econ)
- Using Pluto.jl to build [an interactive version of the model](https://masonrhayes.keybase.pub/projects/pluto/aghion2021.html) from [Aghion et al (2021)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/aghion/publications/environmental-preferences-and-technological-choices-market-competition-clean-or) to see how consumer preferences, market competiton, and technological innovation affect pollution and social welfare
- An essay on [anti-trust and consolidation in the book publishing industry](https://masonrhayes.keybase.pub/essays/book_publishers.html).

Some of my older university projects include [capital concentration in Argentina](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/radical-party/) at the beginning of the 20th century, [populism and economic inequality in Turkey](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/populism-and-inequality-in-turkey/), the optimization of [pay-what-you-want pricing models](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/pwyw/pwyw.pdf), and the relationship between increasing [industrial concentration and inequality in the United States](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/the-inegalitarian-spiral/). 

For my personal projects, I have created a (_now defunct_) R package, [`sciteR`](https://github.com/masonrhayes/sciteR), to gather journal-level citation data from [scite](https://scite.ai), a [Shiny web app](https://masonrhayes.shinyapps.io/coronavirus_app/) to track the spread of COVID-19, and a [simple R script](https://github.com/masonrhayes/cryptocurrency_analysis) to quickly visualize stock or cryptocurrency price trends.
